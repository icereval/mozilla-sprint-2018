# Welcome

This repo is a [contribution](https://github.com/mozilla/global-sprint/issues/285) to the [Mozilla Global Sprint 2018](https://foundation.mozilla.org/opportunity/global-sprint/) and focused on brainstorming for the [Joint Roadmap for Open Science Tools](http://jrost.org) (JROST).

We aim to improve the open science landscape systemically by bringing together a range of open projects to explore how they can be improved collectively and integrated towards a more interoperable open science ecosystem. Participants include Wikidata, Mozilla, Zotero, Hypothesis, DAT, Jupyter, bioRxiv, ORCID, Crossref, OJS, Meta, OSF, PLOS and others (see [full list](http://jrost.org/participants)).

Stonehenge is an example where pieces from different sources had been integrated in a way that harmonized (and still does) with the surrounding landscape. We aim at a similar integration across the open science landscape that is accessible to the public and mindful of the long term, albeit with a more flexible arrangement, and closer to contemporary research workflows.

# Coordination

## Channels

We will have a [Zoom channel](https://zoom.us/j/944190942) and the [#opensciroadmap](https://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=#opensciroadmap) channel on IRC available throughout the sprint. We will also be monitoring the [@OpenSciRoadmap](https://twitter.com/OpenSciRoadmap) handle and the [#OpenSciRoadmap](https://twitter.com/hashtag/opensciroadmap?src=hash) hashtag on Twitter, [along with related handles and hashtags](https://twitter.com/search?f=tweets&vertical=default&q=OpenSciRoadmap%20OR%20openscience%20OR%20openresearch%20OR%20mozsprint%20OR%20TogetherScienceCan).


## Stand-up Meetings

In addition to ongoing communication, participants will gather for short stand-up meetings three times per day live in the [Zoom channel](https://zoom.us/j/944190942) during the sprint on **Thu 10 and Fri 11 May 2018**. Join us there, or on Twitter or IRC to ask and answer questions, talk through ideas, and report on work:
* 9-9:30am EDT (UTC -4)
* 12-12:30pm EDT (UTC -4)
* 16-16:30am EDT (UTC -4)


## Activities

We expect the bulk of the activities during the sprint to result in modifications to [this GitHub repo](https://github.com/OpenScienceRoadmap/mozilla-sprint-2018) and [its issue tracker](https://github.com/OpenScienceRoadmap/mozilla-sprint-2018/issues), to the [repo](https://github.com/OpenScienceRoadmap/OpenScienceRoadmap.github.io) and [issue tracker](https://github.com/OpenScienceRoadmap/OpenScienceRoadmap.github.io/issues) for the [JROST website](http://jrost.org) and (with pointers from our respective issues) to issue trackers and other fora used by projects that form part of the open science landscape, particularly those that participate in the current Mozsprint or that participated in past ones.


## Collaboration

Contributions are welcome from individuals and groups &mdash; physically co-located or distributed, formally established or not &mdash; and we encourage participants to use the above channels to coordinate if, when and how they are working on particular tasks.


## Getting started

We are using [labels](https://github.com/OpenScienceRoadmap/mozilla-sprint-2018/labels) to tag the [issues in this repo](https://github.com/OpenScienceRoadmap/mozilla-sprint-2018/issues):
- [Welcome](https://github.com/OpenScienceRoadmap/mozilla-sprint-2018/labels/welcome): A place where we can share a few words about ourselves and our background or expectations regarding the project.
- [Good first issue](https://github.com/OpenScienceRoadmap/mozilla-sprint-2018/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22): these issues provide ways to familiarize yourself with this project, its contributors and the ecosystem around it
- most of the issues have been tagged with the [mozsprint](https://github.com/OpenScienceRoadmap/mozilla-sprint-2018/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Amozsprint) label that we are using for tickets specific to the sprint
  - issues not tagged this way tend to be about the [Joint Roadmap for Open Science Tools](http://jrost.org) initiative more broadly or on a longer term
- most of the issues have also been tagged with [help wanted](https://github.com/OpenScienceRoadmap/mozilla-sprint-2018/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22help+wanted%22) because that is how Mozsprint projects are expected to highlight issues where help from project-external contributors is particularly welcome.
  - for issues not tagged this way, help is still welcome, but the tag helps prioritize a bit
- most issues have some additional labels:
  - [Review](https://github.com/OpenScienceRoadmap/mozilla-sprint-2018/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3AReview): for issues focused on reviewing what is already there, so as to avoid accidental re-inventions of the wheel, and facilitate intentional collaboration
  - [Curate](https://github.com/OpenScienceRoadmap/mozilla-sprint-2018/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3ACurate): when existing information needs to be indexed, updated, highlighted, restructured, converted or otherwise curated
  - [Create](https://github.com/OpenScienceRoadmap/mozilla-sprint-2018/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3ACreate): when something needs to be created, be it code, documentation, communication, visualization or whatever seems necessary or fruitful
  - [question](https://github.com/OpenScienceRoadmap/mozilla-sprint-2018/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Aquestion): if anything needs discussion or other forms of input from others
- some issues might be about other things, e.g.
  - [logo](https://github.com/OpenScienceRoadmap/mozilla-sprint-2018/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Alogo): for activities related to design a JROST logo
  - [events](https://github.com/OpenScienceRoadmap/mozilla-sprint-2018/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Aevents): for upcoming activites after this sprint


## FAQ

For questions that need attention prior to or during the sprint, please use any of the above channels.

If the sprint activities lead to questions or insights that may be of interest to the broader open science community and beyond this sprint, they should probably go to [Ask Open Science](https://ask-open-science.org/), as per [issue 6](https://github.com/OpenScienceRoadmap/mozilla-sprint-2018/issues/6).


# Timing

The default for participating in Mozsprint activities is 9am-5pm in your time zone. We encourage you to follow that for our project as well, and we will try to be available across multiple time zones to facilitate remote interactions. Our core time zone for the sprint will be US Eastern Daylight Saving Time ([UTC-4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTC%E2%88%9204:00)).
